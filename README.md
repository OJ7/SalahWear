# Salah WearOS App and Complication Data Provider

This is a simple app that shows information of Salah times for your current location on a WearOS watch
it also provides complication data for a supporting watchface, this shows next prayer and one after.

It supports many calculation methods and two Asr calculation methods.


An APK file has been added so that if anyone wants to sideload the app without having to build the app.
And unfortunately PlayStore is not allowing to publish with not much reasoning.
